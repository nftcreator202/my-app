            <p>Hello. I am 34 years old European artist, Emmanuel Pallassi Jr. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>I consider Ammy Phillips, the famous American folk artist, as my mentor and I've learned from his style alot. I am an IRL folk abstract artist and painter from 5 years. All my creations are inspired by God. My style is based upon the ancient primitive civilized society. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>At the young age of 23, I put up adverts to paint peopleâ€™s portraits. After the enhancement of my skills, I finally started the folk art at the age of 29.
            I mixed up the folk and abstract arts to further revive the beauty of my creations.
            I am coming to web3 with my limited collection of folk abstract art. I want to be praised for my art but not for who I am. </p>
